## Description
By using jQuery we had to build a clone Simon Game from scratch. The user would be presented with buttons they had to press in the exact sequence that the app created otherwise the user would lose. HTML and CSS was provided for us. I had to figure out the logic of the game by myself and following instructions the professor left. This project introduced us to a higher level of understanding in Javascript and jQuery.
